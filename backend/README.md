# News-scraper-using-Feedparser-and-RSS
This project is a news scraper that extracts the latest articles from various news sources using RSS feeds and processes them with Feedparser. It fetches news articles based on a user-specified keyword (e.g., company names like "Tesla"), summarizes them, performs sentiment analysis, and provides a structured report.
